## 🎯 Objective

Each player tries to make the **best possible 5-card hand** using:
- **2 private cards** (hole cards) dealt to them
- **5 shared community cards** on the table

The player with the **best hand at showdown**, or the last player remaining after others fold, wins the **pot** (all the chips bet during the round).

   A fourth community card is revealed

4. **The River**:  
   A fifth and final community card is revealed

5. **The Showdown**:  
   Players reveal their hands, and the best 5-card hand wins
