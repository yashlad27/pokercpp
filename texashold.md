## üéØ Objective

Each player tries to make the **best possible 5-card hand** using:
- **2 private cards** (hole cards) dealt to them
- **5 shared community cards** on the table

The player with the **best hand at showdown**, or the last player remaining after others fold, wins the **pot** (all the chips bet during the round).

## üîÅ Game Flow

1. **Pre-Flop**:  
   Each player is dealt 2 private cards (hole cards)

2. **The Flop**:  
   3 community cards are placed face-up in the center

3. **The Turn**:  
   A fourth community card is revealed

4. **The River**:  
   A fifth and final community card is revealed

5. **The Showdown**:  
   Players reveal their hands, and the best 5-card hand wins
